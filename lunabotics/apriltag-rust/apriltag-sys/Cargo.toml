# The source location and build method (cmake, direct cc, link system library)
# is selected by environment variable. Cargo features are not used because these
# are additive and can set by the package(s) that depend on apriltag-sys. (By
# this same logic, we should remove buildtime-bindgen feature and make it an
# environment variable.)
